# hc-mutual-credit
Generic mutual-credit implementation in Holochain

> Work in progress: This is not production ready!

This zome is a generic implementation of a mutual credit system. It's just a piece of the puzzle, and maybe best used with some other zome that implements better membranes.

Next tasks:

* [ ] Create a reusable UI module
* [ ] Add the ability to pass in the currency name and credit limit as parameter
